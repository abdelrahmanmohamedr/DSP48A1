• The Spartan-6 family offers a high ratio of DSP48A1 slices to logic, making it ideal for mathintensive applications.
• We will use Verilog to design the DSP48A1 and will use a bunch of parameters to improve 
the design and make it more felixable
• Simulation done on Questa-sim
• Then we will use Vivado synthesis tool and make sure that the timing and power meets the 
specs and to see the utilization of the project on FPGA xc7a200tffg1156-3 (AMD FPGA)
